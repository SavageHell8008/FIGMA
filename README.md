# Figma to Web – AI-Powered UI Conversion ✨

## 🚀 Overview

This project showcases a user interface I originally designed using **Figma**, which was then **automatically converted into a functional web page** with the help of AI tools. Despite having experience in web development, I chose to explore the power of AI in speeding up the UI-to-code process.

## 🎨 UI Design

- The design was created entirely in **Figma** with a focus on clean layouts, responsive components, and a modern aesthetic.
- Design goals:
  - Intuitive user experience
  - Minimalistic but functional
  - Web-friendly components

## 🤖 AI Conversion

- I utilized **AI-assisted tools** (like Figma plugins or AI web generators) to **transform the Figma design into real HTML/CSS/JS code**.
- The AI interpreted layout, spacing, fonts, and visual hierarchy to produce code that closely matched the original design.
- This eliminated hours of manual front-end coding and enabled faster prototyping.

## 💡 Why This Approach?

Even though I have hands-on experience with web development, I wanted to:
- Explore AI capabilities in front-end automation
- Speed up the design-to-deploy process
- Focus more on **design thinking** than repetitive coding tasks

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Design**: Figma
- **Conversion**: AI UI-to-Code Tools (e.g., Figma to HTML plugin, Uizard, Anima, etc.)
- **Preview/Deployment**: [Netlify]
